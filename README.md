# Liri-node-app
This app uses the OMDB Api to display  information for the movie title that the user inputs into node. 


Before using this app you must clone it and create your own repository and add your own .env file with your personal API keys. You will also need to perform a npm install in your command line to install all of the node packages needed to run this Liri-node-app. 

Then type in a movie title and enjoy all of the information it returns!
